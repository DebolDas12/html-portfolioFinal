<h1>About Me</h1>
<pre>Hi! My name is Debol Das. I am a student at St. James' School, located in West Bengal, India.
   I have a strong interest in web development and have already started my journey by learning HTML. 
  I enjoy exploring new technologies and creating simple web pages. 
  I'm always excited to learn more and grow my skills in the world of coding!</pre>

  <br>
  <pre>As I dive deeper into the world of coding, I hope to build my own websites and maybe 
    even design a cool personal portfolio one day. I'm also interested in learning CSS and JavaScript next, 
    so I can make my web pages look better and add interactive features. Besides coding, I enjoy spending 
    time with friends, exploring new ideas, and staying curious about how things work. With each new skill I learn, 
    I'm one step closer to turning my passion into something bigger in the future.</pre>
